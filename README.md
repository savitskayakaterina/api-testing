# api-testing-REST

I have tested all the methods available for the service https://petstore.swagger.io/ using Postman and created corresponding collections
* [Postman collections](https://www.postman.com/katerinasavitskaya/workspace/my-workspace/collection/26966318-dad42019-8c7e-4cc7-81c6-29c0f3ddf096?action=share&creator=26966318)
 
During the task execution, the following was also done:
- [6 api test cases (positive and negative)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k2z7gl5ZaHlFoKpWSYWDLnFi1WMKgvxBoEloQ1ncQcE/edit#gid=594504188) was written to test the collection requests for the methods in the store block
- A test was written to verify the status code after deleting a pet from the database
- Multiple users were created using the "createdWithArray" method
- Dynamic values were included in the request body for creating a pet, which will be automatically generated upon submission

# api-testing-SOAP
Using this WSDL [this WSDL](http://webservices.oorsprong.org/websamples.countryinfo/CountryInfoService.wso?WSDL), I have created [a working collection in Postman](https://www.postman.com/katerinasavitskaya/workspace/my-workspace/collection/26966318-6a18fd0d-6612-4613-9524-f7e5d8dfeca5?action=share&creator=26966318) that allows to determine the currency of a country, retrieve complete information about a country, and obtain information about the language spoken in a specific country.
